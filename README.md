# TournamentManager

App that allows to manage a game tournament. After created an account user can create new tournament, delete tournament, add to his tournament new players and add results during it. Tournament cannot be deleted when its started.

I am planning to add:
-tournament selector, like group stage tournament, final stage tournament ect.;
-tournament schedule generator appropriate to the tournament type; 

# Technologies that will be used:
Python 3, Django, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS
